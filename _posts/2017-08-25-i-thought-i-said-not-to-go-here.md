Don't read this!!!!!!!!!!

Okay, well... I guess I can't stop you.

Here I am starting a blog of my life. I kept telling everyone I wouldn't make one, too. Nice job me for going back on my word.

In any case, this is the first post I'll be making on my blog, but I really don't really have much first-post worthy stuff to say. I guess I'll just do a quick rundown of my day today. Maybe there'll be something worth talking for a while about...?

Since it's currently summer vacation for the kids here, I haven't started teaching yet. Instead, I've been helping out at a day care for the elementary schoolers in town. 

There are a total of two, one for the western side of town, and one for the eastern side. I've been assigned to the western side for this week, so I headed down there today as normal. I'm only around in the mornings, but the average day consists of: helping kids with their summer homework, looking at books with the kids, and playing games with them. Today I got wrecked at othello like 3 times in a row and played tag for a while before leaving. 

I left around noon and stopped by my employer (the Fukusaki Board of Education) on my way home. Since there was a kids cafe event happening, my supervisor and I stopped by for lunch. I really wish I could have taken some pictures. It was pretty adorable. Imagine a bunch of 1st and 2nd graders in tiny aprons taking your order and serving you food and drink. 

After that, and taking care of some paperwork, I headed on home and started working on this blog.

Okay, there wasn't really anything too crazy today. But it's the small things that count... right?

It's the weekend now, but I don't have any plans at the moment to meet up with friends or anything. So I'll probably spend most of it studying and playing splatoon. Maybe I'll drop in another post this Sunday.

And here's a bonus picture of my town's creepy cute town mascot: ![alt txt](https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2016/10/07/20161007p2a00m0na016000p/9.jpg?1)

The photo I took to the left is of a famous lake in town where the Kappa named 'Gajiro' appears. The Kappa is a famous monster from Japanese folklore that was known for luring people into water and taking their souls through the tushie.

Have a great weekend!!!

Special shoutout to Will for messaging me from a McDonalds in Kumamoto as I was writing this.
