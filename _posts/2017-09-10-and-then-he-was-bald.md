So it's almost been 10 days since my last post here. (I totally didn't forget about this blog or anything ofc)

This week was my first real week teaching. I spent every day at a different elementary school pretty much introducing myself to the teachers and teaching a few classes. The kids were all great and seem to really like me.

Here are some pictures inside Yachikusa Elementary (the 2nd smallest elementary school in Fukusaki). 

It's currently the season for sports festivals, so all of the schools are currently preparing for them. I believe that junior highs will have theirs held on this next Saturday (the 16th), and elementary schools will have theirs on the following one. I'll add more details about it when the festivals actually roll around, but basically all of the school have less periods of actual class per day since the students spend that time practicing for the festival or making materials for it. This also means that I'm probably going to be teaching less classes than normal for the next coming two weeks or so.

As for my relations with the schools themselves, the teachers have all been really helpful. During school hours is pretty busy, but when classes are over, some teachers break-in some light conversation with me and I appreciate the company. I just hope I can remember everyone's names sooner rather than later. (having six schools is no joke...)

Aside from the school classes, I also lead a weekly conversation class for the town every Thursday. It started this week.

Overall I think it went pretty well for a first lesson, but I'm a little worried about how to approach teaching them going forward. I'm handling the beginner class, but their skill levels in English really do vary by so much. I think if I'm going to successfully create an environment where every student has something to gain from the class, I'm going to need to put extra effort in planning lessons (and homework!) every week.

Other than all that, I got a haircut on Friday.
It went okay, but a little too expensive for what I got, I guess. I think I'll be hard pressed to find anyone near me that has experience cutting hair as thick and curly as mine (le sigh..)

I have plans to visit a friend in Hiroshima next weekend (Sun-Mon), but he's still trying to get his hands on discounted tickets for me. So hopefully that pans out.

Thats all for now.

Here's the splatoon track I've been using at the elementary schools for my self-introduction activity. (A spin on hot potato)

I think its my favorite track from the game.
