YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW SPEED??? You've seen nothing yet..!

![speedtest](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/wsIKiYVHPCwsuyX9Za3cQiBNMRdKa3NMviUxLVglSbI/http/puu.sh/xoDqn/87329a3f08.png)

(Of course, I'm talking about internet speed).
I really wish I started out on my company's hikari fiber plan, but then I would've had to wait a much long longer to get working internet. (And two weeks without it was already worse than being in a desert without water..)
Anyways, I've switched over officially to Softbank's hikari fiber service and will be cancelling my Softbank Air in the coming week.

For those of you that don't know, mobile wifi hotspots (portable kinds) are really popular here in Japan. So imagine carrying around your usual devices like cellphone and your laptop, but having an additional brick you carry around to get internet access. These run off of the mobile network's data and as such, can have really bad reception. The Softbank Air I was using until now was simply an at-home and enlarged version. Overall I didn't have many problems with it, but the speed definitely did slow down later in evening. I imagine all the traffic from everyone that made it home was just throttling my speed as well. But, anyways.

Other than that, I had my first dinner with the BoE on Thursday. I, once again, forgot to take pictures, but try to imagine a room with a long and low-seated table, all neatly laid out with traditional japanese sushi and beer. I was designated a seat next to the mayor and another new employee. I think it went well for the most part, but I feel bad for having worried people. I went to the restroom around halfway through because I had to... go (damned metabolism), but people came to the bathroom to check up on me. I was pretty embarassed and felt bad for making them worry.

Then today rolled around and I had my first day of school. (which was at Fukusaki Nishi Junior High). Since it was just the day of the opening ceremony, not too much happened. They did a short award handout for summer tournaments, sung the school song, and held a small earthquake drill. I did give a speech at the same assembly, but that was about it really. After talking to a student about splatoon and eating lunch, I left for home.

Next week will be alot of introductions and alot of super hyper super genki elementary school kids. BUT IM READY.
I think.... maybe

I'll end this post with the song I decided to pick up and try to learn recently.

Feel free to give it a listen.
Cheers!
