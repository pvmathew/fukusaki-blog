Strangely enough, today wasn't the slightest bit humid. (Even though yesterday was hot-shower tier). I heard that fall doesn't hit till October though, so I'm sure this break in the summer weather is only temporary.

My Sundays here are pretty nice. I've become a regular at a local cake cafe (known as Les Baux de Provence) and always bike down there for breakfast.

I didn't take any pictures of the interior today since it was strangely packed, and I didn't want to trouble anyone. That being said, the inside of the cafe looks just as nice as the outside. The staff too are really welcoming everytime I visit. 

I sat at the front today since there weren't any open tables. It's actually the second time I have, but I sort of make an extra effort to avoid conversation with the nice ladies running the shop. I kind of worry about how intimidating it'd be for them to talk to a foreigner so suddenly. So I usually just show up with a book in hand and give it a read while I'm waiting for my food. Today I ordered the simple butter toast set and an iced coffee. Their coffee is really great.

Of course I wouldn't call it a cake cafe if I didn't order any, so I asked for a shortcake after my meal. Here it is pictured below:

If it was any other weekend, I'd usually be relaxing there for a while and trekking through the novel I've been reading, but it was packed, so I decided to leave as soon as I finished eating.

Instead of going home, I stopped by the Joshin in town (think best buy). My brother asked me if I could try to preorder the super famicom, but it seemed like the store wasnt't taking any preorders yet. Aside from that, I looked around the router section since I'll be switching to fiber internet next week and will need one. They were a little expensive though so I'll probably just end up ordering one off Amazon. They also had a big Monster Hunter Double Cross display but I'm already looking forward to getting my hands on MH World, thanks.

After Joshin I headed on down to Tsutaya Way (think blockbuster) to check for an option to preorder the same console. No dice. Tsutaya carries alot of albums for bands I like (for rent and sale), but I still dont have a working CD drive. I'll probably be picking up one real soon.

Right next door to the Tsutaya is a book store (Ukaiya), which I walked into and perused for a bit. I've been trying to figure out which store in town is the first to have the newest issue of Shounen Jump for sale (a weekly manga issue). So far, I still haven't found a place that's carrying this week's issue. I guess the more inaka you are, the slower you are to get the most recent issue. I did, however, buy the 1st volume of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, which is a pretty cute series I recommend.


Today'll probably be me studying and working on my self-introduction lesson. I have a total of six schools, so I'll be re-presenting the same lesson quite a few times for the first 2 months or so. My partner ALT has been offering me alot of advice, so I'm sure I'll get it punched out in no time.

I'll end this post with a song I've been hooked into recently called 命ばっかり (Nothing but Life) by ぬゆり (Nuyuri). In short, it's a song about being dissatisfied with one's self and the emotions that follow in suit.

I hope everyone's doing well!
