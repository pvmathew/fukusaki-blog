As of this past weekend, sports festival season has finally come to a close. It feels like time has been passing faster than normal, but I guess this just comes with age. It’s my first time working full-time technically, so I’m sure that’s a factor too.

I didn’t forget to take any pictures of the school festivals, but I feel like I shouldn’t post any up on here out of people’s privacy, so I’ll refrain from doing so. (So you’ll have to live with just my incredible and flawless retelling. Sorry!)

Last weekend there was a typhoon, so the sports day for Fukusaki Nishi was postponed to the following Monday. Man was it a hot day (sweat, sweat, and more sweat). They had me helping out for event preparations and cleaning up, but overall I had a great time. I even had the chance to participate in the student-teacher relay, so that was a blast too. Out of all the events, I think the double dutch and kiba-sen were my favorites. The PTA put together their own team and participated in the double dutch event. Super long jump ropes were brought out and the parents were all jumping together (a huge group of like 30 people). Needless to say the students won, but it was really fun to watch.

In the kiba-sen, or calvary battle, 3 male students prop up one to form human calvary team. That team has to knock down the opposing team’s head to obtain victory. I actually didn’t think this was a real event, but one that only appears in anime or manga. I was happy to find myself proven wrong. There was a large scale deathmatch style battle and individual duels that followed. Both were super exciting to watch. Red team was particularly strong here.

Then just yesterday the elementary schools in town held their sports day. Sadly, I had much less of a role and did nothing but clean up. At Takaoka they were nice enough to throw me into the basketball game on the PTA team, so I was super thankful for that. I only made one in though (lol).

Both sports days ended for me with an onsen trip and enkai. I still don’t like drinking, but it was nice to see everyone have a chance to catch a break from work and soak some conversation in. For better or for worse, work really is life for Japanese people here. Even more so for teachers, since they’re basically the parents for students while they’re at school. I’m just an ALT, so of course I don’t have as much responsibility, but I hope I can do meaningful things in my own way. 

The students all seem to like me, so maybe I’m doing okay so far. They’re definitely the best part of being an ALT. If there’s anyone reading this blog that’s considering applying to be an ALT in the future, I’d think long and hard what it is you hope to get out of the program. If you have your own goals, and have the motivation to apply yourself towards them on your own, you’ll be fine. But, if you just want to see japan and live here, you can break really easily. Not just from loneliness, but from all the culture shock. I’ve lived here before, and sort of came here knowing what to expect, but  Japan can really be a dark place if you look closely.

In my pursuit of acquisition of Japanese, I’ve taken upon myself to try reading a lot more recently. Last week I finally finished my first book.

And no, I’m a cat person. For those of you who can’t read Japanese, the title of the book roughly translates to “Dog Stories from Heaven.” It’s a collection of 5 short stories about different dogs and their life changing encounters with humans. I particularly was fond of the last one, a story about a dog that was abandoned that saves a small girl from being kidnapped. I found the stories all to be pretty moving, but it was, at the same time, a very simple read. I never had to reread any sentences since all of the kanji had rubi; I’d say it was around 4th grader level material.

Now I’m reading a novel called 打ち上げ花火、下から見るか 横から見るか (*Fireworks, Should We See It from the Side or the Bottom?*). It recently had an anime movie adaptation, which had rave reviews, so I decided to try and give the book a shot. I really can’t handle any intensive reading without losing interest, so I’ve been working at it with an extensive mindset. (no looking up words or rereading sentences). Man, do I still need to study a lot of kanji. I feel like on average 40% of kanji I have absolutely no idea how to read. Since this book isn’t for elementary schoolers, there’s no furigana either, so if there’s a character I don’t know, I usually skip the whole word.

That being said, I’m happy that I can still keep up with the story and understand what’s happening. I really want to improve my reading ability as soon as possible. As soon as I’m done Kodansha’s KLC, I’ll be hitting the books for what I feel like will be a long time.

I also just finished reading all of Slam Dunk today, so in respect to it I’ll end this post with a clip of favorite quote from the manga.

Shout out to the teme-family for playing ranked with me today.

Cheers!
