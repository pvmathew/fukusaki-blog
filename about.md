Since I'll mostly be using this blog to update friends and family, I think most people will already know who I am. Just in case, here's a small tid bit about me:

My name is Pavin Mathew and I'm currently living in the town of Fukusaki in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. After graduating from U.C. Davis in early 2017, I was flown out through the JET Program and placed here to teach English. I was born and raised in the US, so this is pretty much my first time staying abroad for an extended period of time. As such, I thought it might be worth it to leave a record of my experiences here.

I studied Computer Science and Japanese in university and am conversationally fluent in Japanese. I came to Japan with the goal of becoming better at the language.

As for hobbies, I play alot of video games and like playing the guitar. I also spend alot of time watching Japanese youtubers and studying Kanji/trekking through Japanese novels to pass the time.

Thats about it... I think?

I'll probably update this page with a picture and stuff later.
I hope you enjoy your stay!
